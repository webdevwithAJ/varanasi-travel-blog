            The land flourished until 12th century, when invaders destructed most of the ancient Kashi. Many Muslim rulers destroyed Varanasi for three centuries until Akbar came into throne to restore the city to its previous glory, only to be again destroyed by Aurangzeb in 17th century. In 18th century, Varanasi was announced as a separated kingdom, with the capital at Ramnagar. British declared it as a separate state in the beginning of 20th century.
